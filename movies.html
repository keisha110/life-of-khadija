            <h2>Inception</h2>
            <p>
               It is the most mind-blowing movie I've ever seen!
               It's a movie about how people can go into their dreams and actually share dreams and change stuff but there are certain limits because it's real for you so if you got shot you would actually die in real life.

            <img src="ted.jpg" width="250px">
            <h2>Ted</h2>
            <p>
                It's mostly about a man who made a wish when he was young that his teddy bear would talk so he would have a friend and then throughout life he keeps him and they go through a lot.
               This is the best comedy I've ever seen!It was hilarious!It does have some profanity!But it's mostly a clean movie so watch it if you can!

            <h2>Madea Goes To Jail</h2>
            <p>
            It's about Madea doing stuff against the law and her nephew working with a client who is sort of family.
               This is also the best comedy I've ever seen!It was hilarious!It does have some some prfoanity but again you could still watch it!Try watching all the Madea series!
